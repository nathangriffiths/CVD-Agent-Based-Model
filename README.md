# CVD-Agent-Based-Model

This repository contains the implementation of an agent-based-model of behaviour spread and its impact on cardiovascular disease developed by the project "Modelling the spread of multiple behavioural risk factors for cardiovascular disease in social networks using an agent-based model", N. Griffiths, O. Oyebode and J. Archbold, funded by MRC as part of the Population Health Agent-based Simulation nEtwork (PHASE).

The paper describing the model is under preparation, and if you use our model in your own puplications we would appreciate you citing our paper (details to be added here on publication). There is also a webinar describing the model here (see 58:40 onwards): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD6Y1LcjxXE
